# Knowledgebase Repository Analysis

## Critical Bug Fix
- **Problem**: `worker/worker_tasks.py` could not even be imported because of an unterminated SQL string and a stray SQL comment inserted outside of a string literal inside `ensure_pg_schema()`. This broke any runtime that touches the worker module and also prevented `pytest` from collecting tests.
- **Fix**: Closed the SQL string for the `idx_docs_categoria` index and converted the stray `--` SQL comment into a Python comment so that the module is syntactically valid again.

## Outstanding Issues & Bugs
1. **`test_extract_text.py` is not a real pytest test**  
   The file defines `test_extraction(test_dir)` but never supplies a `test_dir` fixture, so `pytest` fails during collection. The module is really meant to be executed as a script. Convert it into a parametrized pytest test (e.g., use `tmp_path` to create fixtures) or move it under a different name if it is meant to stay a CLI helper.
2. **Missing fallbacks around LibreOffice conversions**  
   `_libreoffice_convert()` assumes `libreoffice` is available and always succeeds within 60 seconds. When LibreOffice is not installed or when conversion times out, ingestion aborts without useful diagnostics. Catch `FileNotFoundError` and `TimeoutExpired` and push a descriptive failure into the Redis queue so operators can react.
3. **Lack of throttling / batching strategy for large corpora**  
   `run_ingestion()` walks the entire repository, keeps a growing Python list of file paths, and pushes batches of 50 documents to Meilisearch. On very large datasets this will load everything into memory and keep a PostgreSQL cursor open for a long time. Consider streaming with `os.scandir()` and committing smaller transactions to reduce resource contention.

## Suggested Improvements
- **Test coverage**: Add unit tests for `_read_text()` and `extract_metadata()` that mock the filesystem. This would let CI catch regressions without requiring LibreOffice or external binaries.
- **Configuration validation**: At startup, verify connectivity to Redis, PostgreSQL, and Meilisearch with clearer error messages (currently only Meilisearch init is guarded).
- **Observability**: Wrap ingestion steps with structured logging (e.g., `logging` or `structlog`) to help diagnose long-running jobs. Also persist ingestion metrics in Postgres so that `/progress` can be rehydrated after restarts.
- **Deployment hygiene**: The repository contains alternate worker scripts (`worker_tasks_NEW.py`, `patch_worker_tasks.diff`). Remove or archive stale variants to avoid confusion during deployment.
